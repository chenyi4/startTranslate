Neptune is the planet of inspiration. The higher octave of Venus, Neptune brings beauty to a higher, more spiritual level. It also holds sway over dreams, the subconscious, illusions, fantasies and all things magical and enchanting.

Neptune intensifies intuition and teaches us to be deeply compassionate. Neptune often asks us to sacrifice for the greater good or for love of another.

Neptune refines, purifies, and cleanses. Any planet visiting Neptune will come away purer. This planet cannot bear coarseness. Highly sensitive Neptune gets us more in tune with subtlety, and therefore increases the artistic side of one’s personality. Neptune rules all visual communication, whether with symbols or gestures, such as photography, film, ballet and other dance arts, music, painting and poetry.

Neptune also rules the sea and all other bodies of water. It governs rain, ice, and liquids of all kinds; including beverages and alcohol. Neptune also rules drugs; both the bad ones, which make us suffer, and the good ones, which make us well.

Neptune is known as the Planet of Mist. It makes us want to escape mundane, everyday reality and to enter a more ideal, heavenly state. It urges us to excel and to exceed boundaries, to reject any and all limitations.

But since Neptune alters reality and clouds our perceptions of it, there are times that Neptune complicates issues and makes it hard to decipher facts. Neptune can make us deceive ourselves (or be deceived by others), or just make us misunderstand or be misunderstood. It rules all that is glamorous and sparkling. Bear in mind that Neptune’s visions are not always real. (It’s Saturn’s job to give us the cold, hard truth.) We need a planet to inspire us. That is Neptune’s province.

Neptune is the ruler of Pisces. It takes 146 years to circle the zodiac, with a stay of about fourteen years in each sign.
