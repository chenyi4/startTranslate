The moon drives your deepest feelings, the fine-tuning of your character, your instinct and intuition, your emotions, and your reactions. The moon also rules your private life, especially your home. Since the moon is feminine in nature, it rules your mother and how you perceive her, and does the same for any other important females in your life, including your wife, girlfriend, or a female boss, your grandmother, girlfriend or wife.

If the Sun represents where you are going, the Moon signifies where youâ€™ve been. More specifically, the moon rules your history, your background, emotional development, and your roots. Your ability to get in touch with your feelings is dictated by planetary aspects to the Moon.

The dynamics surrounding the moon can also indicate the state of your health, especially if you are female. The moon rules the sign of Cancer, the stomach and breasts, and the light of night (obviously, moonlight). The moon, which takes approximately 28 days to orbit the zodiac, spends two to three days in each sign every month.

Every month there is a new moon. Depending where it falls in your horoscope, it shows which areas would be favored for new beginnings. A full moon arrives two weeks after the new moon; depending on where that moon falls in the chart, it could be time to reap the benefits or consequences of earlier actions.
