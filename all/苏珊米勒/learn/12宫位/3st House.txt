The third house rules your mind and intellect. It reveals how you approach and analyze problems, 
and how you perceive information. Basically, it drives your overall learning and communicative processes.
 For example, this house administers skills in writing, editing, speaking, thinking, reading, and conducting 
research. It covers your ability and desire to learn, and brings study opportunities your way. Under
 the influence of this house, someone would decide to learn languages or become a teacher. 
Other endeavors covered here are the drafting of contracts and agreements, presentation of ideas and
 proposals, and commerce, including sales, marketing, public relations and self-promotion.

This house covers your neighborhood, short-distance trips, and all means of local transportation and 
shipping.

The third house also regulates fundamental education (nursery school through high school), drives your 
relationships with siblings, cousins and neighbors and, finally, covers your perception of childhood 
experiences.

This house is ruled by the intellectual, communicative planet, Mercury and by the versatile Gemini.
