This is the house that encourages us to think big and bold, and to consider the future in the broadest terms.
 There always seems to be a certain amount of preparation required before one can take full advantage of 
all that the ninth house has to offer. Long distance travel, international communication, interactions and
 relationships with foreigners, distant relatives and in-laws, and higher education are the key areas covered
