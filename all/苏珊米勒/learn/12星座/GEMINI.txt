GEMINI (May 21-June 21)

You are the zodiac’s most skilled communicator. You read a lot, and you write beautifully. Friends know that when there’s breaking news, you are their go-to person to find out more, for you will be among the first to have the details. Gemini believes that one of the best gifts you can give is the gift of information—you’ll hear Gemini say, “Guess what I just learned!” This may sound like gossip, but as a Gemini, you are far too intellectual to spend a lot of time on that. Your brain is continually analyzing things, and being the sign of the journalist, you do this to get to the truth.

These are some of the reasons why you work so well in the media, in documentaries, news, television, the Internet, advertising, public relations, marketing, telecommunications, app development, and software coding, among other communicative professions. You’re also such a skilled negotiator, so persuasive and articulate, that you would excel in sales or working as an agent. The industries of travel, couriers, aviation, automotive, and shipping also offer areas where you would excel, for your ruler, Mercury, not only gives you a sharp intellect but also an enjoyment of travel and transportation.

You are classified as a mutable sign, so you are the most versatile and adaptable of signs. When you encounter a plan that does not work, Gemini goes to plan B and plan C with ease, continually coming up with equally workable plans that occurred to no one else on the team.

As a Gemini, you are fortunate that you look and act younger than your years, all through life, for your sign is tied to the myth of Pan, which in modern day we came to know as Peter Pan. (The story of Pan is actually a much more beautiful myth than the version we all know from cartoons.) Your charming childlike curiosity, youthful mannerisms, witty, split-second sense of humor, usually slim frame, and interest in all that is new (including fashion) make everyone guess you are at least ten years younger than your birthday would reveal.

Gemini men and women love fashion because, of course, it’s new and ever changing, and you are the one sign that carefully studies every look to find the one that fits her or his style the most. The one area that appeals strongly to the Gemini woman is accessories, for Gemini women usually have a beautiful arsenal of quality scarves, handbags, shoes, necklaces, bracelets, and other up-to-the-minute accessories that add polish and chic to your outfit and express your individual style. It’s no wonder many fashion editors and critics are Gemini—they can’t wait to spread the news. Male Gemini stay up on fashion by reading men’s magazines, Internet reports, and newspapers that have a personal section that focuses on men from time to time, such as the New York Times or The Wall St. Journal.
