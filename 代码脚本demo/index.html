    Dear Reader:

Greetings from New York City, from my house to yours. I have been in quarantine since March 17. Even so, I have not been binge watching TV shows—I have been using the time to create surprises for you. I will have a big announcement in my Note from Susan Miller in August, after these eclipses are over and Mercury has turned direct. There will be other surprises coming down the pike, too. I have been using my time alone very productively!

This month’s eclipse on July 4-5 marks the end of the Capricorn-Cancer series of eclipses that have arrived every six months in pairs. The Cancer-Capricorn series first began in July 2018 and will end now. A new family of eclipses is staring up on the Sagittarius-Gemini axis, and we saw the first on June 5, a very tender, emotional full moon lunar eclipse. Both Gemini and Sagittarius are focused on finding truth and justice, so the emphasis will change from the Cancer and Capricorn focus on money, power, and structure.


You are a brave soul, facing the difficulties of life with strategic equanimity and quiet determination, qualities that allow you to march forward with grace and fortitude. You may not be aware that you inspire many who come to know you. You have been tested in many ways lately, but that test is almost over.

My mother had the moon in Capricorn, and I once asked her why she never complained when life’s difficulties came her way. She explained that what was happening to her was not her fault, certainly not anyone’s fault—it “just is.” She never asked why she was singled out by the universe to experience turbulent times, for she felt we all have bouts of those from time. She felt it was not productive to worry about things you could not change, but to focus only on the ones you could.

Some of her tests were severe, yet my sister and I never heard complaints or the slightest tone of self-pity. Sometimes life is that way, she would say, and she understood that life is not always fair—she didn’t expect it to be. She taught me astrology, so she knew well which cycles were causing which tests, and she accepted them. Looking at your chart, dear Capricorn, I feel you are very much like my mother.

I think the greatest gift my mother gave me was her emphasis on the need to be practical and to have realistic expectations. So much sorrow in life is caused by wrong assumptions. Once you have those set as straight and accurately as possible, you can reach for the stars, for you will have built a sturdy foundation. That was her moon in Capricorn speaking, and I bet she echoed words you would have said, too.

You have had a host of challenging aspects in recent years. It all started back in 2008 when Pluto entered Capricorn. This was not a testing aspect as much as it was one of fortifying and boosting your inner strength. Pluto’s power is illustrated by the image of the phoenix rising from the ashes of defeat. When you have a prominent Pluto in your chart, either in the natal chart or as a transiting planet (as you absolutely do have now), you find that your ability to rebound from devastating conditions is legendary. Lucky you, you will continue to have transiting Pluto in your sign until 2024.

Pluto moves slowly, for as the planet that spins on the outermost track of our solar system, it takes him the longest to circle the Sun: 248 years. As you can understand, less than half the population ever gets to experience Pluto in their own Sun sign as you have now. Pluto is teaching you how to rise above difficult circumstances.

Yet there were tougher challenges to come, each one there to test your mettle and to ready you for bigger responsibilities. Capricorn is known to be the ambitious career sign, always willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead. Yet leadership takes more than experience, it takes a mature individual who can bring out the best of those in his employ. Here you shine, for Plato called Capricorn the Philosopher King who always took good care of those in his employ.

Jupiter in Capricorn and Neptune in Pisces will be in perfect sync through most of 2020. Concentrate on getting your project done this year. You will find all kinds of inspiration now, and your project is apt to bring you a generous fee.

Since December 2017, you’ve been dealing with the rare and challenging visit of stern Saturn in Capricorn. Saturn is your ruling planet, so you, more than other signs, cope better with the demands of Saturn. Saturn has put you through your paces, toughened you up, seasoned you by throwing challenging experiences at you, and demanded your entire concentration to the matters at hand. Saturn doesn’t want to see you distracted, and you were willing to step up to all the universe—and Saturn—was asking of you. He readied you to take on bigger goals. Saturn teaches that only through hard work and sacrifice can we realize our greatest dreams, which, once achieved, will make you feel proud to say you accomplished them.

Recently, for a short while, from March 21 to July 1, Saturn moved into Aquarius, the sign it will visit next in 2021 through early March 2023. The idea was to give you a small breather from the pressure you were under form the constant stress you were feeling. Alas, the respite was short, only a few weeks long, so you probably barely noticed it. When Saturn leaves your sign on December 16, he will not to return to Capricorn for decades, not until February 2047. This is why Saturn teaches with tough love—he has to be sure you retain all he is teaching you because it will be so long until he can return to give you a refresher course.

One sweet quality of Saturn is that he always leaves a gift by the door as he exits as thanks to you for dealing with his vigorous lessons. Saturn will leave December 16, so by January 2021, you will start to be in line to see your reward—material, spiritual, or emotional. You will know your gift has arrived when you see it.

As if having Saturn and Pluto both in Capricorn weren’t enough, you also had to deal with two years of eclipses in Capricorn and your opposite sign of Cancer, and the Cancer eclipses particularly tested the strength of your partnerships.

All eclipses fall on either new or full moons. Eclipses are super-strong and act a little differently from normal full and new moons. They bring with them a different timetable of when they will deliver their news, too. New moon eclipses are always called solar eclipses, and they tend to bring happy events—they are known to open doors and offer fresh opportunities. All lunar eclipses are full moons and are known to mark a culmination or ending, which often will produce an emotional response. Some bring happy events, and others, more sentimental ones.

Keep in mind that eclipses are the most dramatic tool the universe uses to create rapid change, and they deliver their news suddenly and out of left field. An eclipse will also provide a floodlight of truth, so when you take the clue and puzzle piece it delivers to you and place it into the larger picture, it suddenly changes your view of a situation and allows you to understand it in a new way. In other words, eclipses bring on eureka moments for they offer unexpected information to provide insight.

Have a look at the list below of the eclipses you’ve already come through. If your birthday is named, plus or minus five days, it likely affected you more than other Capricorns. Keep in mind that I have not listed eclipses that appeared in other signs in 2018 and 2019—only those in your sign and Cancer. For example, just last month we had an eclipse in a new family of signs on June 5 in Sagittarius, a highly emotional full moon that sparked a global revolution for equality in the Black Lives Matter movement which was sparked by the horrendous death of George Floyd. The new eclipses are moving to the signs Sagittarius and the opposite sign, on the same axis, of Gemini. Both signs are interested in truth and justice.

Below are the recent eclipses in your sign and Cancer since 2018. Note which ones marked a big event for you. If your birthday is listed, or within five days of the date, you would likely have felt that eclipse.

July 12, 2018, in Cancer, 21 degrees, a solar eclipse that affected those born January 12.

January 5, 2019, Capricorn, 15 degrees, a solar eclipse.

July 2, 2019, Cancer, 11 degrees, solar eclipse, that affected those born January 2.

July 16, 2019, Cancer, 24 degrees, lunar eclipse, that affected those born January 15.

December 24-25, 2019, Capricorn, 4 degrees, a solar eclipse.

January 10, 2020, Capricorn, 20 degrees, a full moon lunar eclipse.

June 21, 2020, Cancer, 0 degrees, solar eclipse, affecting those born December 21.

July 4-5 in Capricorn, 14 degrees, full moon lunar eclipse. This eclipse will mainly affect those born within five days of January 4, and I will discuss it more in a moment.

When you look over this list, I almost guarantee one or two dates will stand out for you. As you see, they fall in different degrees. The way you can know if an eclipse will affect you is if the mathematical degrees of that eclipse match those of your birthday Sun or one of the planets in your natal chart.

Here is an important point: Sometimes an eclipse will affect you one month to the day earlier or one month to the day later. So, for example, the July 4-5 eclipse may have already affected you deeply on June 5 or will later on August 5. (June 5 was an eclipse in Sagittarius, so you may have felt that one for other reasons found in your chart.)

Now there is another way an eclipse can affect you. We need to watch when Mars or Saturn runs over the degrees of an eclipse or forms a square or opposition to that eclipse degree. Saturn is too deep in Capricorn to affect the July 4-5 eclipse, but Mars will qualify. Watch July 22 when Mars reaches 14 degrees Aries and will make a 90-degree square to the eclipse. Watch July 22 for big news if your birthday falls on January 4, plus or minus five days, and not much happens near July 4-5 for you.

Now let’s turn to this month and look closer.

On July 4-5 we have a full moon lunar eclipse in your sign of Capricorn—it will be the very last in the series. After this eclipse, you can rest for there won’t be any more eclipses in your sign and opposite sign of Cancer again until mid-2027-2029. In addition to those born January 4 (plus or minus five days), those who have Capricorn rising at 14 degrees or have a natal moon or planet at 14 degrees in Capricorn, Cancer, Aries, or Libra will feel this eclipse. If you have a natal planet in Scorpio, Pisces, Taurus, or Virgo at 14 degrees, plus or minus five degrees, you will be helped by this eclipse.

Because this full moon falls in your sign, Capricorn, it will give you a chance to see yourself in a new light. You might even change your appearance to reflect the changes and enlightenment going on within you. If you are bored with your job or feel your relationship has run its course, you might now make a decisive change. The rule of an eclipse is, respond but do not initiate—not yet. Wait to announce a sweeping change. Having said that, it’s not always possible to wait, for big life events tend to happen on eclipses.

Mars will be in hard angle to the transiting Cancer Sun (a square) and also to the full moon eclipse in Capricorn (another square). Mars went into Aries, your fourth house of home and family, at the end of last month and will remain in this sector for an exceptionally long time—six months rather than six weeks. Mars will continue to emphasize your home and family sector until January 6, 2021.

Mars often brings noise, so you might be moving, having a massive repair job done at home (or other property you might own or rent), or are finishing up a major renovation. If you feel you need to refresh your décor, you may be having several large pieces of furniture delivered now. Or you might be having house guests, and if your guest(s) plan to stay only two weeks, you can bet their stay will go much longer.

Another way Mars might make his presence known is that you might see a family squabble or a full-out argument erupt. Things could get heated because we have an emotional full moon here. I do hope this is not how things work out for you.

Sometimes Mars manifests energy not in a physical way (you move) but in an emotional way (you argue). In that respect, because your partner is being tied into this eclipse, it could be that your family does not like your partner, and your relationship is causing problems within your family and also with your significant other. Your parents are ruled by the fourth house too, so you may need to invite your parents to live with you so that you can care for them for a time, and this may be causing some difficulty with your romantic steady or spouse.

It appears you will have a disagreement with your partner, for money seems to be a sticky point of contention. I say that because the Sun is opposed to Saturn and Pluto, so the disagreement could get forceful.

Still, there are sweet parts to this eclipse, too. Your children are a bright spot, for Uranus in your child sector (fifth house) will send a beam to the eclipsed full moon and the Sun. If you are leaving your partner (possible), because often on an eclipse someone (in this example, your partner) is “eclipsed out” of your life at the time, it looks like child custody will not be a sticking point—finding a solution would be surprisingly quick on that point. Finding agreement about money, joint property, and possessions, however, will take time if you are splitting up a relationship.

Eclipses ask us to adjust to rapidly changing events. No matter what your plans may be these days regarding a partnership goal, your timetable will speed up dramatically. That’s because something happening out in the world that has nothing to do with you—an event, action, or decision—will have a way of touching you and your partner anyway, even if you didn’t even know about it. Somehow, if you trace events, you will see that something outside found a way to your door and has a direct effect on your life.

This is a full moon, so whatever occurs has a history or background of things moving in this direction, although you may not have been consciously aware of this.

Now let’s look at the July 20 new moon in Cancer, 28 degrees. This is not an eclipse, it’s a normal new moon, but it will be a strong one nevertheless. Saturn will oppose the new moon in Cancer, so it appears your spouse, steady date, or established partner will be under a great deal of stress, and as a result, you will feel tension, too. You may notice that you and your partner are not on the same page over a matter that comes up. Because this is a new moon, any discussion that surfaces will take time to fix—the timeline of a new moon is usually six months.

Again, the topic of money will arise. The division of joint property or the amount of money each person contributes or appropriates will be a major topic of debate at this July 20 new moon.

Pluto will also oppose this new moon, indicating you might be tempted to become too anxious to win at all costs during a debate with your partner in love or business. Pluto likes to have total control, and you might feel you need that too, but if you are too dominant, you may win the battle but lose the war. Rather than damage the relationship by pulling out all the stops with sticks of dynamite, instead, try to have a quiet discussion first, even if it’s hard to do. It just might do the trick. Words matter, and you won’t be able to take back your comments later, especially if you mortally wound your partner (very possible).

If you become upset by what news comes up—and it will likely be something you didn’t know before—agree to think about what your partner has said. Instantly break that connection for that day before you say something you regret. Don’t assume too much—you need to ask questions. Plan to regroup in a few days.

Mercury will be retrograde earlier in the month, a holdover from June 17, but having turned direct on July 12 will be moving to return to his former strength. That won’t fully happen until July 27—it always takes time for a planet to ramp up to its former strength after it turns direct. You will have time to think and to talk things out. It may be that you are taking on a new responsibility, possibly involving a parent, and you will need to marshal other family members’ help as you ease into your new role.

Now let’s turn to the communication of two planets that rarely talk, and when they do, they bring on divine, inspirational harmony.

Earlier, I had not mentioned that Jupiter, the good luck planet is also in Capricorn. (Yes, it seems almost everything is your sign—Jupiter, Saturn, Pluto, and the July 4-5 full moon eclipse are all in Capricorn—a lot of energy favoring your corner of the sky.) Jupiter will be close enough to the full moon to be significant, and that means that your close partner in love or business could work out to be quite be helpful to you. In life we often have many partners—our spouse, steady, committed sweetheart, our business partner, lawyer, accountant, agent—you get the idea.

If you are in a creative field or work in the arts or as an actor, your ideas and expressions will be positively brilliant this month. If your creativity focuses on writing novels or imaginative fictional screenplays, you will also hit a home run. Jupiter in Capricorn and Neptune in Pisces will be in perfect sync through most of 2020. Concentrate on getting your project done this year. You will find all kinds of inspiration now, and your project is apt to bring you a generous fee.

Jupiter and Neptune are rarely in such perfect harmony, so this aspect is a major feature of 2020. They first formed a sextile on February 20. (A sextile is when two planets are 60 degrees apart, forging opportunity.) They will form another sextile on July 27, but both will be in retrograde, rendering them a bit weak. Neptune in your third house of communication (favoring imaginative writing, speaking, and communicating in the digital world) and profit-oriented Jupiter will meet one more time on October 12, when they will be in strong orbit again and no longer retrograde.

Jupiter and Neptune will not be in harmony again until they meet in gorgeous conjunction in Pisces in April 2022. While you have the cooperation of expansive, financial Jupiter and imaginative Neptune helping you be so creative, use this time to your benefit! I mentioned above that you have Uranus in your creative house heating up your ideas, so you have all the right conditions for creating a spectacular success!

SUMMARY

When you were younger, you may have dreamed of having a key role in your company, possibly as CEO. Over the past two years you have been readied for an important leadership role, personally or professionally. Planets have tested you in all different ways, and because most planets were in Capricorn, you felt those tests more sharply than most—this period is temporary and will end soon, certainly by the end of 2020.

Additionally, we are now in eclipse season and are coming to the last one in a long series of eclipses in Capricorn and your opposite sign of Cancer. Eclipses in one’s sign often bring news and enlightenment but also a need to adjust swiftly to rapidly changing conditions that have the power to change your future course.

The solar new moon eclipse of last month, June 21, may have brought an opportunity to make a pledge or promise to a partner, in love—such as to plan to marry—or to take on a formal business partner or agent. Or it may be that you decided that you and your partner need to part—eclipses tend to make for high contrast conditions on either end of the spectrum that can’t be ignored. The universe wants to see progress, and if a situation has stagnated, an eclipse will get you moving again.

Either way—to join forces in love or business, or to split—you will need to proceed slowly because last month Mercury started to retrograde, and you likely found that talks were developing in fits and starts, gradually and haltingly. Until Mercury goes direct, you’d be wise not to seal anything in stone. Wait a few days after July 12 (the date Mercury normalizes his orbit)—act on July 16.

This month, the last Capricorn-Cancer eclipse is due, arriving July 4-5 as a full moon lunar eclipse in Capricorn. This one will clarify the future direction with one particular partner who is either one you want to commit to and form a stronger partnership, or to end the relationship because you feel it has run its course and is not working any longer.

You will feel this eclipse strongly if you were born on January 4, plus or minus five days. Eclipses always require adjustments, and they deliver news without warning. They also bring the bright shining light of truth, and in so doing you will likely see your needs and desires in an entirely new light.

The new moon of July 20 will again have you meditating about your romantic or business partner, and with Saturn and Pluto exerting a strong challenge, the universe will test your resolve to commit fully to your partner or else to leave. This will be a new moon, opening a new path, but the question is, which of the two paths will you choose? To grow closer or to break up? There is no predestined outcome, for the final resolve will be up to you. It is an important decision point.

Meanwhile, Mars will move through your home sector in hard angle to your Sun, so if you break up, it’s likely you would move and have your own place. However, on the other end of the spectrum, if you are getting engaged, this final eclipse in Capricorn might have you seeking a new apartment or house for the two of you and excitedly looking forward to your marriage. Eclipses make feelings very clear—it’s either promise your love, or leave without looking back.

Make no final decisions while Mercury, the planet of intellectual thinking, is retrograde, a trend he started June 17 and will continue to July 12. Sometimes, though, we have to act to capture the opportunity, such as if you find a house or new apartment you love. If you can wait until month’s end, do, but if you can’t, weigh the situation. You can always move to a new apartment again if you are signing a rental agreement during the retrograde. If you are closing on a house, however, that brings up more serious thinking, for it will be too difficult to move again anytime soon. Keep in mind you will host Mars in your fourth house of home continuously until January 6, 2021, an unusually long period, and Mars will continue to bring you a variety of opportunities, but not good ones when Mars retrogrades from September 9 to November 13. You will have several chances to move during July and August if you decide to wait.


If you are working on a launch, the fact that Mars is in Aries suggests that the project would be new and entrepreneurial—you may be forging a path that no one has ever walked before. Alternatively, the outgo of money you will see might point to the possibility of higher-than usual expenses, possibly because you are undergoing a lifestyle change. In that regard, you might be moving to a new home, getting married, having a baby, or going to college or graduate school. While your outgo will be high now and in the coming months, you may have planned for this period, and certainly the money would be well spent.

Also, under this trend activated by Mars, you will be motivated to find new sources of income. To that end, you may be working hard to come up with new strategies and techniques to improve your cash flow and also have money left over for you to save or spend. Mars will retrograde from September 9 to November 13, so if you are about to launch a new project, do so after July 16 through the end of August, or wait to launch in December or January. Those are the best months to see your dream realized.


They first signaled each other on February 20 this year, linking expansive, financial Jupiter in Capricorn to artistic Neptune in Pisces. They were 60 degrees apart, creating a sextile, and that translates into the bubbling up of opportunity for profit from creative expressions.

This month, on July 27, Jupiter and Neptune will make the same aspect again. Jupiter and Neptune will both be retrograde, making it the perfect time to go back to a project you had put aside some time ago. Dear Pisces, reignite that project—it’s the ideal time to do so. It would be a shame not to capture the lyrical energy that Neptune and Jupiter are creating for you! Pisces is the one sign in the perfect position to take full advantage of this trend.

Before these two planets part and spin off in their separate directions, Jupiter and Neptune will create one more aspect on October 12. At the time, Jupiter will be moving direct and be strong, allowing Jupiter to bring you a generous sum for work done on a creative assignment. After October 12, this aspect will start to fade like perfume into the air. It will not be until 2022 that you will get another shot of Jupiter and Neptune’s extraordinary help. Dear Pisces, this is your time!

Please Note: On October 1, 2020, there is a full moon in Aries 9º, not Aquarius 9º. We apologize for this error in our 2020 calendar.

SUMMARY

In many ways, June and July were to be the key turning points of the year. Most years hold four eclipses, but this year we have six (and if we count the one that came by December 24, 2019, we have seven). Eclipses are the tool that the universe uses to create the most dramatic changes in our lives. They bring surprise events, and they demand almost instant adjustment.
