    Eclipses ask us to adjust to rapidly changing events. No matter what your plans may be these days regarding a partnership goal, your timetable will speed up dramatically. That’s because something happening out in the world that has nothing to do with you—an event, action, or decision—will have a way of touching you and your partner anyway, even if you didn’t even know about it. Somehow, if you trace events, you will see that something outside found a way to your door and has a direct effect on your life.

This is a full moon, so whatever occurs has a history or background of things moving in this direction, although you may not have been consciously aware of this.

Now let’s look at the July 20 new moon in Cancer, 28 degrees. This is not an eclipse, it’s a normal new moon, but it will be a strong one nevertheless. Saturn will oppose the new moon in Cancer, so it appears your spouse, steady date, or established partner will be under a great deal of stress, and as a result, you will feel tension, too. You may notice that you and your partner are not on the same page over a matter that comes up. Because this is a new moon, any discussion that surfaces will take time to fix—the timeline of a new moon is usually six months.

Again, the topic of money will arise. The division of joint property or the amount of money each person contributes or appropriates will be a major topic of debate at this July 20 new moon.

Pluto will also oppose this new moon, indicating you might be tempted to become too anxious to win at all costs during a debate with your partner in love or business. Pluto likes to have total control, and you might feel you need that too, but if you are too dominant, you may win the battle but lose the war. Rather than damage the relationship by pulling out all the stops with sticks of dynamite, instead, try to have a quiet discussion first, even if it’s hard to do. It just might do the trick. Words matter, and you won’t be able to take back your comments later, especially if you mortally wound your partner (very possible).

If you become upset by what news comes up—and it will likely be something you didn’t know before—agree to think about what your partner has said. Instantly break that connection for that day before you say something you regret. Don’t assume too much—you need to ask questions. Plan to regroup in a few days.

Mercury will be retrograde earlier in the month, a holdover from June 17, but having turned direct on July 12 will be moving to return to his former strength. That won’t fully happen until July 27—it always takes time for a planet to ramp up to its former strength after it turns direct. You will have time to think and to talk things out. It may be that you are taking on a new responsibility, possibly involving a parent, and you will need to marshal other family members’ help as you ease into your new role.

Now let’s turn to the communication of two planets that rarely talk, and when they do, they bring on divine, inspirational harmony.

Earlier, I had not mentioned that Jupiter, the good luck planet is also in Capricorn. (Yes, it seems almost everything is your sign—Jupiter, Saturn, Pluto, and the July 4-5 full moon eclipse are all in Capricorn—a lot of energy favoring your corner of the sky.) Jupiter will be close enough to the full moon to be significant, and that means that your close partner in love or business could work out to be quite be helpful to you. In life we often have many partners—our spouse, steady, committed sweetheart, our business partner, lawyer, accountant, agent—you get the idea.

If you are in a creative field or work in the arts or as an actor, your ideas and expressions will be positively brilliant this month. If your creativity focuses on writing novels or imaginative fictional screenplays, you will also hit a home run. Jupiter in Capricorn and Neptune in Pisces will be in perfect sync through most of 2020. Concentrate on getting your project done this year. You will find all kinds of inspiration now, and your project is apt to bring you a generous fee.

Jupiter and Neptune are rarely in such perfect harmony, so this aspect is a major feature of 2020. They first formed a sextile on February 20. (A sextile is when two planets are 60 degrees apart, forging opportunity.) They will form another sextile on July 27, but both will be in retrograde, rendering them a bit weak. Neptune in your third house of communication (favoring imaginative writing, speaking, and communicating in the digital world) and profit-oriented Jupiter will meet one more time on October 12, when they will be in strong orbit again and no longer retrograde.

Jupiter and Neptune will not be in harmony again until they meet in gorgeous conjunction in Pisces in April 2022. While you have the cooperation of expansive, financial Jupiter and imaginative Neptune helping you be so creative, use this time to your benefit! I mentioned above that you have Uranus in your creative house heating up your ideas, so you have all the right conditions for creating a spectacular success!
