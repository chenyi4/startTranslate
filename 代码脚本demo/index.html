    You are a brave soul, facing the difficulties of life with strategic equanimity and quiet determination, qualities that allow you to march forward with grace and fortitude. You may not be aware that you inspire many who come to know you. You have been tested in many ways lately, but that test is almost over.

My mother had the moon in Capricorn, and I once asked her why she never complained when life’s difficulties came her way. She explained that what was happening to her was not her fault, certainly not anyone’s fault—it “just is.” She never asked why she was singled out by the universe to experience turbulent times, for she felt we all have bouts of those from time. She felt it was not productive to worry about things you could not change, but to focus only on the ones you could.

Some of her tests were severe, yet my sister and I never heard complaints or the slightest tone of self-pity. Sometimes life is that way, she would say, and she understood that life is not always fair—she didn’t expect it to be. She taught me astrology, so she knew well which cycles were causing which tests, and she accepted them. Looking at your chart, dear Capricorn, I feel you are very much like my mother.

I think the greatest gift my mother gave me was her emphasis on the need to be practical and to have realistic expectations. So much sorrow in life is caused by wrong assumptions. Once you have those set as straight and accurately as possible, you can reach for the stars, for you will have built a sturdy foundation. That was her moon in Capricorn speaking, and I bet she echoed words you would have said, too.

You have had a host of challenging aspects in recent years. It all started back in 2008 when Pluto entered Capricorn. This was not a testing aspect as much as it was one of fortifying and boosting your inner strength. Pluto’s power is illustrated by the image of the phoenix rising from the ashes of defeat. When you have a prominent Pluto in your chart, either in the natal chart or as a transiting planet (as you absolutely do have now), you find that your ability to rebound from devastating conditions is legendary. Lucky you, you will continue to have transiting Pluto in your sign until 2024.

Pluto moves slowly, for as the planet that spins on the outermost track of our solar system, it takes him the longest to circle the Sun: 248 years. As you can understand, less than half the population ever gets to experience Pluto in their own Sun sign as you have now. Pluto is teaching you how to rise above difficult circumstances.

Yet there were tougher challenges to come, each one there to test your mettle and to ready you for bigger responsibilities. Capricorn is known to be the ambitious career sign, always willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead. Yet leadership takes more than experience, it takes a mature individual who can bring out the best of those in his employ. Here you shine, for Plato called Capricorn the Philosopher King who always took good care of those in his employ.

Jupiter in Capricorn and Neptune in Pisces will be in perfect sync through most of 2020. Concentrate on getting your project done this year. You will find all kinds of inspiration now, and your project is apt to bring you a generous fee.

Since December 2017, you’ve been dealing with the rare and challenging visit of stern Saturn in Capricorn. Saturn is your ruling planet, so you, more than other signs, cope better with the demands of Saturn. Saturn has put you through your paces, toughened you up, seasoned you by throwing challenging experiences at you, and demanded your entire concentration to the matters at hand. Saturn doesn’t want to see you distracted, and you were willing to step up to all the universe—and Saturn—was asking of you. He readied you to take on bigger goals. Saturn teaches that only through hard work and sacrifice can we realize our greatest dreams, which, once achieved, will make you feel proud to say you accomplished them.

Recently, for a short while, from March 21 to July 1, Saturn moved into Aquarius, the sign it will visit next in 2021 through early March 2023. The idea was to give you a small breather from the pressure you were under form the constant stress you were feeling. Alas, the respite was short, only a few weeks long, so you probably barely noticed it. When Saturn leaves your sign on December 16, he will not to return to Capricorn for decades, not until February 2047. This is why Saturn teaches with tough love—he has to be sure you retain all he is teaching you because it will be so long until he can return to give you a refresher course.

One sweet quality of Saturn is that he always leaves a gift by the door as he exits as thanks to you for dealing with his vigorous lessons. Saturn will leave December 16, so by January 2021, you will start to be in line to see your reward—material, spiritual, or emotional. You will know your gift has arrived when you see it.

As if having Saturn and Pluto both in Capricorn weren’t enough, you also had to deal with two years of eclipses in Capricorn and your opposite sign of Cancer, and the Cancer eclipses particularly tested the strength of your partnerships.

All eclipses fall on either new or full moons. Eclipses are super-strong and act a little differently from normal full and new moons. They bring with them a different timetable of when they will deliver their news, too. New moon eclipses are always called solar eclipses, and they tend to bring happy events—they are known to open doors and offer fresh opportunities. All lunar eclipses are full moons and are known to mark a culmination or ending, which often will produce an emotional response. Some bring happy events, and others, more sentimental ones.

Keep in mind that eclipses are the most dramatic tool the universe uses to create rapid change, and they deliver their news suddenly and out of left field. An eclipse will also provide a floodlight of truth, so when you take the clue and puzzle piece it delivers to you and place it into the larger picture, it suddenly changes your view of a situation and allows you to understand it in a new way. In other words, eclipses bring on eureka moments for they offer unexpected information to provide insight.

Have a look at the list below of the eclipses you’ve already come through. If your birthday is named, plus or minus five days, it likely affected you more than other Capricorns. Keep in mind that I have not listed eclipses that appeared in other signs in 2018 and 2019—only those in your sign and Cancer. For example, just last month we had an eclipse in a new family of signs on June 5 in Sagittarius, a highly emotional full moon that sparked a global revolution for equality in the Black Lives Matter movement which was sparked by the horrendous death of George Floyd. The new eclipses are moving to the signs Sagittarius and the opposite sign, on the same axis, of Gemini. Both signs are interested in truth and justice.

Below are the recent eclipses in your sign and Cancer since 2018. Note which ones marked a big event for you. If your birthday is listed, or within five days of the date, you would likely have felt that eclipse.

July 12, 2018, in Cancer, 21 degrees, a solar eclipse that affected those born January 12.

January 5, 2019, Capricorn, 15 degrees, a solar eclipse.
