    A series of eclipses have been blowing through, with two last month and one more to go in July. Eclipses each have personalities of their own, and no two are precisely alike, although it is true that an eclipse will repeat in sign and degree every 19 years to the day. That would bring you back to July 2001, but of course, the planets surrounding that eclipse have since changed, so all you can glean by looking back is a theme or a clue to let you know what is coming.

On July 4-5, we have a full moon lunar eclipse in Capricorn, 14 degrees, lighting your twelfth house of confidential matters. Eclipses bring a brilliant amount of light to the area they train their energy on, so in this case, you might hear a secret that has been withheld from you. When you hear it, it will change everything, and of course when you confront the person about why they kept this information from you, at first they may deny it. At the same time, there are many planets in the twelfth house sharpening your instinct and intuition, so if you strongly sense that there is more to the story, keep pressing, for the planets in your twelfth house will not let you down.

Eclipses bring truth, so sooner or later you will get to the bottom of what is happening, and because this is a full moon, you will get closure. A mystery that has puzzled you because nothing was adding up in your mind will suddenly make sense when the extra clue is revealed. You might be shocked by the news—eclipses do that—but let’s hope this is not the way things will work out for you.

The role of an eclipse is to test the strength of relationships and their conditions. By bringing glaring daylight to a condition that you didn’t know about or ignored by underestimating its importance, the eclipse can help you protect yourself and also cleanse the situation. Eclipses will get you moving again—they don’t like to see a situation languish or stagnate—the universe is built on productivity. Keep in mind that an eclipse is a lot like a heat-seeking missile, looking for problems. If it finds none, it will move on, and you won’t notice much at eclipse time. If there are no secrets to uncover, this possible outcome of this eclipse will not apply to you.
