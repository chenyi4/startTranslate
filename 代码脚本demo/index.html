    Capricorn Horoscope For August 2020

Dear Reader:

I will make my note to you short, as I am having such trouble seeing the screen. The words appear broken to me, but fortunately, I type so much that my fingers know the where the keys are.

I have a very serious eye condition that is genetic. I have been seeing my world-famous retina specialist for 11 years and getting the treatment I need. Things have been going gradually downhill, and now I am in real trouble. I have a dream team of doctors here in New York City who know of each other and who are working together to try to help me save whatever sight I have left. My Aunt Faye, now 102 years old, has it too, and she went blind, but there are new medicines that were not available to her when this started. It is a disorder all over my family tree—my doctor calls it a genetic overload. Extreme results from this disorder aren’t supposed to hit until you are about 85, but for me, I was first diagnosed at 35. My surgeon has an idea he feels will help me. I am praying to Saint Lucy, the patron saint of eyesight every day. Saint Lucy has helped me quite a bit in the past.

YOUR HOROSCOPE BY SUSAN MILLER
This is a month of high contrast. Admittedly, the full moon found at the start of the month will be nobody’s favorite. It will appear in Aquarius, your second house of earned income, but the problem is that Uranus will be in at sharp odds to the full moon in Aquarius and at the same time to the Sun in Leo. Both these signs cut across your financial sectors (second and eighth houses), so some sort of unexpected news is likely to arrive out of the blue.

This means you could have an unexpected expense having to do with a surprise pregnancy, a child you have now, or a creative project that will need an unanticipated infusion of cash. Some kind of change is coming to your financial life, but it might be precipitated by you if you decide to tear away from your present job and either start your own business or join another firm. Some Capricorns will make a complete career switch into another industry—anything is possible when Uranus is involved. Uranus is the planet of independence, so that’s possible, or it may be that a client, friend, ex, or other person will fail to pay you when promised. As a Capricorn, you are known to be resourceful, and you might need to use that talent now.

News at full moons brings matters to a climax, and then they are over. Usually we all have to attend to news that comes up, but the news of a full moon generally does not linger. Don’t worry though, for on the heels of this full moon comes a very helpful and encouraging new moon. Let’s talk about that now.

The new moon will arrive on August 18 in Leo, 27 degrees, and bring a fresh gust of air to your eighth house of other people’s money. This would be an ideal time to put in your application for a mortgage, business bank loan, car or home improvement loan, government COVID stimulus program (such as PPP in the US), line of credit from your bank, or student financial aid. If you have a good credit rating, your timing for making application on or quickly after August 18 couldn’t be better.

Your eighth house, which will be so strongly lit for you in a favorable way, is the area of the chart where we need to shop for money to accomplish a big goal, such as to start a business, get a college degree, or buy a house. The funds needed are usually beyond the amount the average person would have in the bank, so working with other people’s money is necessary. Credit cards, inheritance, insurance payouts, tax reductions or refunds, commissions, cash advances, valuable gifts, royalties, and licensing fees all come under this house. As you see, there are many possible sources of the funds you need. One of these areas may prove lucky for you (if none do, your parents may help you out, as your chart shows help from family, too).

I love that Mars will support this new moon from your home and family sector and beam straight up to the trio of heavenly bodies in your eighth house of other people’s money—the Sun, new moon, and Mercury. Any kind of home or property matter will shine, and you will come away pleased with how the application process progressed. If you have a plan to help your mother or father, say, to help get an at-home aid or to help select an assisted living facility, Mars, strong this month, will help you find options. If you wait, you may not find a long-term solution for your parent until late November or December.

You seem to have an enormous emphasis on your home and family. Recently, on June 27, Mars entered your fourth house of home, and Mars has been focusing your attention there. Mars usually remains in a house for six weeks, but in this visit of Mars, he will remain six months. That’s plenty of time to accomplish all that you hope to achieve.

August 25 will bring Mercury in Virgo, your travel house, receiving romantic vibrations from the surprise planet Uranus. If you get a chance to take a car trip to a remote location, take it!

You may plan to move, buy or sell a house, rent an apartment, or renovate, redecorate, or order repairs. You might work to declutter your space and closets, paint, or schedule a thorough cleaning project. In fact, you may schedule more than one of these aims on the list. Or you may search for a solution for your mother or father. You may try to find the right medical specialist to help her, or an aid to come live with him. Get as much done this month as possible, for very soon, Mars, the planet focusing you on home and family matters, will retrograde—from September 9 to November 13—and you will run into delays. During Mars retrograde, I am not in favor of closing on a house or signing a lease (unless you plan to have the apartment only a short time).

There is another problem with this Mars retrograde. Mars’ little brother Mercury, the little copycat that he can be, will also go retrograde during a large portion of the Mars retrograde period. Mars will retrograde September 9 to November 13, and little Dennis-the-Menace Mercury will go retrograde from October 13 to November 3. You can imagine how hard it will be to get anything going.

Mars is the energy planet that increases productivity and spurs motivation. When Mars sleeps, the world misses his power and strength. Most of us take Mars’ help for granted because he retrogrades only every two years. He is the spark that starts the engine. Without Mars, it is hard to get things moving. We find we run into delays, indecision, and low productivity. It is never wise to launch a new product or service when Mars is retrograde, nor is it wise to open a new business during Mars retrograde. You would not want to put Mars retrograde into the DNA of the new venture.

We feel the retrogrades of the three so-called personal planets more than we do the outer planets because they orbit closest to earth. Those planets are Venus, Mars, and Mercury. We already had Venus retrograde from May 12 to June 24 earlier this year, and soon we’ll have Mars. Mercury retrogrades three times a year, so we are always seem to be feeling Mercury retrograde.

To help you understand what it means when Mars retrogrades, let me give you some facts. When Mars is orbiting in healthy, normal, and energetic form, it takes him two days to travel one degree. When he is about to go retrograde, it takes him 12 days to go one degree. He does manage to speed up in the middle of his retrograde, taking four days to cover one degree, but that’s still double the amount of time that he would normally take (two days for one degree). The bottom line is that everyone, of every sign, will feel the slowdown. The economy will not percolate just yet—instead, we will feel like we are all walking in glue with very slow progress.

I feel we have to brace for a second wave of the coronavirus in October through early December 2020 because Jupiter and Pluto, the two planets that spread the virus, will meet one more time in conjunction before spinning off in separate directions. This would explain the agonizingly slow months near the end of 2020.

Jupiter and Pluto are due to meet on November 12, and that would explain why things will be at a standstill. With Mars playing into this scenario too, we will have a slow economy worldwide from October through mid-December. After November 12, these two slow moving planets, Jupiter and Pluto, will begin to separate and spin off on their individual orbits, not to meet again for 13 years.

Both planets are retrograde now, but will awaken, rested and energetic, by mid-September (Jupiter), and Pluto will quickly follow, going direct in the first week of October. I feel October through early December will be our most dangerous time for the virus to re-emerge, but I do not know where this will happen. I do feel we will have a vaccine or treatment by Christmas, or certainly by January 12, 2021, when Jupiter and Pluto will be ten degrees apart. After that, we seem not to be thinking about the virus as much, so I assume we will enter a safe zone.

Astrology is not destiny. If you are determined not to become a victim of this virus, you will stay home in quarantine, always wear a mask in public, and keep washing your hands. As the weather cools off, it will be easier to wear gloves too, especially in the supermarket (they say the cart is where the bacteria lie, and also on bank’s ATM machines).

Now we come to my favorite part of the month, the last week of August.

August 25 will bring Mercury in Virgo, your travel house, receiving romantic vibrations from the surprise planet Uranus. If you get a chance to take a car trip to a remote location, take it! By this time of the month, you will be tired of working so hard on your finances and will crave relief. If you can go to a beautiful wooded area, take the chance to have a fun road trip.

On August 27, Venus and Neptune, another gorgeous aspect for love and fun, will come up, and with Venus touring your close, committed relationship house, those who are attached will have the edge. Let your partner choose what you will do—it seems to involve a little car trip, this time near water. (With Neptune prominent, that would be perfect!)

On August 28-29, Mercury in Virgo and Jupiter in Capricorn will be working in sync, making for a fantastic set of days, especially for signing a contract. This would also be a great time to introduce an app or new website, or turn in your manuscript for your new book. Travel will also be very special, but remember, stay away from others to stay healthy.

Now, we come to the full moon on September 1 in Pisces, ten degrees, one of the finest full moons of the year. I love that Uranus, planet of surprise, will contact this full moon in the most exiting way (a trine aspect), producing the best environment for finding love and growing closer in love if you are attached. This full moon will glow in your short-distance travel sector, so it looks like you will be away the last week of August, enjoying some serendipity while on your car trip. If you are not sure where to go, a full moon in Pisces makes it clear—go to a cottage by the sea or rent an Airbnb in a quant lobster town. Either would be ideal.

This full moon will give every Capricorn the diversion you likely feel you need. You’ve been cooped up at home, thinking about money, career, work projects, home, and family. Last month brought the last group of eclipses in Cancer (June 21) and Capricorn (July 4-5), and they may have required adjustment, too. Considering all you have been through, you need a rest and a change of scene. This new moon will help you get it it.

If money is a concern this month, you may hear from your sister, brother, or cousin who may kindly offer you and your family a place to stay, and if so, accept! You will return refreshed and brimming with ideas of what you’d like to do next. Creatively, you will be in peak form at this beautiful full moon.

—————————————–
Please Note: On October 1, 2020, there is a full moon in Aries 9º, not Aquarius 9º. We apologize for this error in our 2020 calendar.

SUMMARY

Over the past two years the universe has put you through several trials to test your mettle. You have met challenges head-on with a spirit of confidence and cool objectivity each time in the face of considerable pressure. For two years, you were hammered by taskmaster Saturn in Capricorn as well as a series of powerful eclipses in Capricorn and Cancer, the sign opposite your Sun (oppositions can be especially tough). Those eclipses started coming by every six months starting in July 2018, and they required a number of adjustments. You are now seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

The very last eclipses in Cancer and Capricorn just appeared June 21 and July 4-5, so you will now be able to rest. They will not be back until July 2027 to July 2029. Once Saturn leaves Capricorn on December 16, 2020, he will not be back to your sign until 2047. As you see, you are close to the end.

If you did not notice any news last month near July 4-5 from the eclipse in Capricorn, sometimes, in about 15% of the cases, an eclipse will deliver its message one month to the day later, in this case August 4-5, minus two days and plus five days. Keep your antenna up. That eclipse was in Capricorn. It will help you see yourself and your abilities in a new light and help to clarify the path ahead.

Looking at this month, the full moon of August 3 won’t be anyone’s favorite. It will fall in Aquarius, and Aquarius’ ruler, Uranus, now in Taurus, will be in harsh 90-degree angle to both the full moon in Aquarius and, on the other side of the sky, the Sun in Leo, creating, perhaps, a touchy situation regarding a business partner, agent, publicist, or other specialist

It is also possible that instead, it will affect your relationship with a partner (romantic or professional) and help you to articulate what you need in that partner to be happy. The matter seems to involve money that you feel is due you, but it also goes deeper, to your everyday interactions.

If you have a home-related project you had to put on the shelf and wait for better days, you may now return to that home-related goal. You may be interested in buying, selling, or renting property, renovating, decorating, or doing other activities to improve your living space. This trend is being encouraged by the unusually long tour of Mars through your home sector, extending to January 6, 2021. Alternatively, you may be taking special care of your mother or father or hosting a family member as a long-term house guest. Mars in your home sector almost always brings noise, so there will be lots of commotion at home base and lots of talk with family members. It sounds exciting.

In the middle of this trend, Mars will go retrograde, from September 9 to November 13, not a time to make any important home or family-related actions, such as to sign legal papers, hire a contractor, or choose an assisted living situation for your parent, as a few examples. Do it in August, and have that decision finalized by September 1.

That date, September 1, is the date of the full moon in Pisces, your third house of agreements, decisions, and communication. It happens to be a divine full moon, for the planets will blend beautifully with your Capricorn Sun. Uranus will be in ideal attitude to the Sun at this time and could bring you an unanticipated windfall of money.
