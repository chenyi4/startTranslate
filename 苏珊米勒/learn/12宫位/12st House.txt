The twelfth house rules the subconscious mind, dreams, intuition, instinct, and secrets. In fact, 
it dominates all that’s hidden, including activities going on behind the scenes and confidential 
engagements.

Psychotherapy and psychic phenomena both fall under this house as part of its rule over the subconscious 
mind. Dynamics acting on this house can heighten our hunches and intuition.

The ancients wrote that “self-undoing”, meaning anything we do to undermine ourselves, also comes 
under this house. It governs of rest, reaching the end of long cycles – and the termination of any and all
 confinement, such as hospital stays, nursing home residences or even jail sentences.

This is the house we go to to heal ourselves. It also rules self-sacrifice, inner suffering, limitations and secret
 enemies. Lastly, this house rules charity, especially on a one-on-one basis.

A little known fact is that all large animals come under the domain of the twelfth house.

The twelfth house is ruled by spiritual and self-sacrificing Neptune and by compassionate Pisces.
