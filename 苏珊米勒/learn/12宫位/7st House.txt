The seventh house rules marriage, business partnerships and any serious contractual agreement between 
two people or entities.

This house holds both the possibility of completion of an agreement or of conflict. Your open enemies and 
detractors would be covered here, as would your staunchest allies.

This house also manages experts you hire: attorneys, agents or others who represent or collaborate with you.


For most people, the seventh house is most significant as an indication of the status of a marriage partner. 
This house describes what you need most from your significant other, and the rapport that develops 
between you.

Please note that romantic love is reflected in the fifth house, but once a commitment is made, that promise 
moves the relationship to the seventh house. The “contract” made between two people, or two entities, 
may be written or verbal.

The seventh house is ruled by gentle, refined Venus and by the partnering sign of Libra.
