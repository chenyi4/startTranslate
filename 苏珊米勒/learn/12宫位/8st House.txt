This house is about rebirth, regeneration and the transformation of energy. 
Joint financial matters also come under the eighth house. (To the ancients, 
money is a form of concentrated energy.) The financial dealings in this house do not include earned income 
(that would be covered by the second house), but do cover money you lend and also owe others. Prizes, 
gifts, inheritances, tax payments and refunds, bonuses, commissions, royalties, child support, alimony,
 mortgages, credit, loans and venture capitol are the kinds of transactions ruled by the eighth house.

Any time you need money to fund a big idea, your chances for success would all come under this house. 
This house also would indicate the state of your partner’s prosperity.

Gifts and transactions of all kinds are included in this house, and physical love‹sex and reproduction‹is also
 included here. (Note that in astrology, the fifth house is love, the seventh house is marriage and the eighth 
house is sex, all different houses.) Spiritual and highly intuitive or even psychic experiences are often found
 in this house too (along with the twelfth house). Finally, this house rules endings and things to be discarded. 
As such, surgery is covered here.

This house is ruled by Mars and co-ruled by catalyst Pluto and by the intense sign Scorpio.
